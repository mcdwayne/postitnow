# postitnow


Utility scripted in Bash to post markdown files from either your local environment or your github repo to a site on Pantheon.  
If posting from Github, find the last saved file in my blog drafts folder and post that if synced, fail otherwise.


I am going to ask for the following: 
    > Permalink you prefer, default is title
    > The Featured Image


## Requirements!!
- Bash  (with cURL working)

- Permissions turned to "Read for Everyone" for the files you want to drag/drop into the terminal locally

- An existing Pantheon site

- Pantheon's Terminus

- Content files in Markdown 
	- File names can not contain spaces (not going to deal with regex for now)
	- The first line will be used as the title
	- The rest will populate the body field

- 'markdown-editor' plugin (or something on your site that can interpret markdown for the post as it is created by the WP-CLI via Terminus)

- A Github account where you sync your local content folder. 


## Also Included:

#### postit_installer 

Bash script to copy the script and set it in the user/bin/
for both postit and postitnow


## Installation:

1. Clone down the repo or grab and unpack the zip

2. Modify postitnow in place with the following variables

	`SITENAME=<sitename>`  -  sitename is the name of the site on Pantheon, no spaces
	
	`ENV=PantheonEnvironment` - the environment we are posting to on Pantheon 

	If you want to use the 'post last thing synced to Github' feature you need to additionally set

	`LOCALREPO=/localfolder` - your local folder synced to GITHUBREPO

	`GITHUBREPO='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/master/remotefolder/' ` - your github synced to LOCALREPO

	

3. Run the following from bash terminal

```
cd PATH/postit
chmod +x postit_installer 
./postit_installer
```

4. To run, type `postitnow` and feed it what it asks for


### Usage

If installed via path above, simply type `postitnow` into the terminal and feed it what it asks for:

1. A file location.  If left blank, going to pull from Github.
	- Expecting a file written in markdown 
	- First line should be title you want
	- Rest is stuffed into Body field


2. Permalink you prefer, default is filename

3. The Featured Image

4. Alt text for Image - fail if not set

5. Tags for the posts, is expecting slugs, if new slug will create term that is equal to slug


### Example 
```
~/Documents/postit $postit
Where is the RAW file? (Must be RAW) : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcdwayne/postit/master/README.md
What should the permalink be? : this-is-a-valid-permalink
